# Automation Bin Directory

Trying to find a good name for this directory that is not in use by other tools and that makes sense.

This directory contains scripts for automating build, test and deployment activities for this application.

In the spirit of the `/sbin` directory (a.k.a. _system binaries_), which contains executables for system administration, and the `/usr/rbin` directory (a.k.a. _restricted binaries_), which contains executables that require elevated permissions to run, I'm trying out `abin` for _automation binaries_. (Yes, everybody knows these aren't binaries, but binaries in this sense has come to mean _executables_.) Maybe this name will stick.

It still sorts near the top of the list alphabetically, so it's in the same general spot as when we used `bin` or `auto` for the directory name.
